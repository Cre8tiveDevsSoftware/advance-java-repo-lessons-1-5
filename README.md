Setting Up a Spring Boot Application This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a Spring Boot application.

Prerequisites Before starting the setup process, ensure you have the following:

Git installed on your machine MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench installed Java Development Kit (JDK) installed Setup Steps Clone the repository:

Run the following command in your terminal: git clone <repository_url> Download and install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench from the official MySQL website.

Launch MySQL Workbench and create a new schema named autohire. This schema will be used by the application.

Import the SQL file into the autohire schema:

Open MySQL Workbench and go to the "Server" menu. Select "Data Import". Choose the SQL file located in the project's /resources folder. Import the SQL file into the autohire schema. Verify the table creation:

Check the autohire schema in MySQL Workbench to ensure the tables are created. Run the Spring Boot application:

Open the Spring Boot project in your Intellj (IDE). Locate the AutohireApplication class and run it. This will start the Spring Boot application and initialize an embedded Tomcat server. Alternatively, you can run the application using the following command in the terminal:

./mvnw spring-boot:run Access the Swagger UI:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html.

This will open the Swagger UI, where you can explore and interact with the application's APIs.

Note: If port 8080 is already in use on your machine, you can change the port in the application.properties file located in the project's /src/main/resources directory.
